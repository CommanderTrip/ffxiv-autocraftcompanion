# Auto Craft Companion - A fully AFK Crafting Macro for FFXIV

Set FFXIV to windowed mode and move it to another monitor/to the side, hover over "Synthesize", start the macro with AutoHotKey and enjoy some YouTube while you make that Gil!

## TODO

- [ ] Add the option to use 2 keys for a two step macro i.e. not relying on the penumbra plugin "Macrochain"
- [ ] Add the option to create profiles to auto load different preferences
- [ ] Add the ability to re-up Food and/or Potion when needed
